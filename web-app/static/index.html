            Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) helps to elect a candidate who reflects a majority of voters in a single 
            election even when several viable candidates are in the race.
            RCV is a way to ensure elections are fair for all voters. It allows 
            voters the option to rank candidates in order of preference: one, two, three, and so forth.
        </p>

        <p>
            In races where voters select one winner, if a candidate receives more than half of the first choices,
             that candidate wins, just like in any other election. However, if there is no majority winner after
              counting first choices, the race is decided by an "instant runoff." The candidate with the fewest 
              votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as ‘number 1’ will have their votes count 
              for their next choice. This process continues until there’s a majority winner or a candidate won with 
              more than half of the vote.
